    * It's better to use virtual environment to segerate the packages to projects. So create a virtual environment
        ```
        pip install virtualenv # Install virtualenv
        
        cd phones_api_project # Go to project directory
        
        virtualenv environment_name # This will create a folder with name 'environment_name'
        
        source environment_name/bin/activate # Now you are in an environment and packages installed will be local to this environment
        
        pip install beautifulsoup4 # We will need this for running the script
        
        python scrape.py # Run the python script
        ```
